  <h2>WELCOME</h2>
  <p>
    I first came across the word 'jocoseriousness' in December of 2019 when a Professor of mine had used it to remark on my awareness of voices in James Joyce's Ulysses: "you seem to have perfectly understood the logic of this novel's jocoseriousness, how even when things appear funny or quirky, there's often an ethical, political or philosophical conclusion to draw". Though my life experiences are not similar to the plot of a a novel as such, there are paralells to draw from moments, experiences and instances which appear on face value jocular, that like Joyce's epic, are indeed profound.
    <p>
      Stepping aside and away from the context of Joyce, whom I have grown to love, I think the notion of things, people and ideas being 'jocoserious' is one that is fruitful. It also captures the essense of my own being. I am jocoserious - both serious and jocular - in every aspect of the word. Perhaps it's the unwanted (of course, natural) transition from being a teenager to now, an adult with adult-like responsibilities that has made me oxymoronically jocoserious.

    <p>
      My intention for this site stemmed from an overwhleming desire to have a type of hub- someplace where my ramblings are collated digitally, a virtual space, hidden as much as it is public to share with anyone interested. Self-centeredly, I also very much rejoice in discussing and analysing my own personal predicaments and often, scenarios I have very much constructed in my head.

   <p>
    This site is nothing short of a vanity project.

  <h2>MACDIARMID AND THE KIND OF POETRY I WANT</h2>

  <p>
    People often ask me the type of poetry I like and the answer to that is extremely long winded. In short, I don't know
    what my 'type' is. All I know is that when I read poetry I am looking for one thing and one thing only: to feel a
    specific <i>type</i> of way.

  <p>
    I recently studied the intersectinality between poetry and politics (which I suggest you all do) and in this learing
    process discovered Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid. Now MacDiarmid was an interesting man; he grew up in rural Scotland
    and his life was very surrounded by mills and the machinery of labour. He eventually contributed to founding the
    National Party of Scotland, was a member of the Communist party and was deemed a Communist Sympathiser according to
    Briitsh intelligency agencies. Interestingly, MacDiarmid was expelled from both the National Party of Scotland and
    eventually the Communist Party on multiple occassion. To say he was controversial and eclectic is an understatement.
  <p>

    For many who know me, one of my greatest loves is the love of modernist literature. I love Joyce and his obsession
    with cats. I think of Eliot when the unreality of reality is overwhelming. My appreciation for the simplicity of
    material object is much owed to Williams. I can drunkenly recite Pound from memory at parties with strange men just so
    they know that I am serious about my writing. Why this is important to mention in relation to MacDiarmid is that as
    distant from the modernism movement he was, in a strange way, he was connected to and took inspiration from this
    movement.

  <p>
    MacDiarmid's first works were published in 1923, a year after Joyce, Eliot and Williams. MacDiarmid wrote <i>The Kind
    of Poetry I Want</i> later in his life (1961) and this work of poetry contains fragments of modernism overlayed with
    the politics that overshadowed much of his life.

  <p>
    Here is an extract from MacDiarmid's <i>The Kind of Poetry I Want</i> which you can see his focus on the internal
    structure and the bodily composition of materials:
  <p>

    <i>A poetry that never for a moment forgets
      <br>That if we study the position of the foetus
      <br>As it appears in about the ninth month
      <br>Of its development, we see the tiny body
      <br>Curled up with its head bowed over,
      <br>The hands crossed, and the knees drawn up
      <br>To permit the whole structure
      <br>Of bones, muscles, nerves
      <br>And arteries to fit comfortably
      <br>Into the cage or matrix.</i>

  <p>
    From being inspired by MacDiarmid, I thought to put down in writing what kind of poetry I wanted or at least my
    expectations from poetry. I opted for a short poem with allusions to <i> The Waste Land </i> of course. My intention
    here wasn't to write a poem that features drugs and substance abuse but instead to suggest that poetry is dangerous
    and the parameters of a poem itself is like skirting the edge of a skyscraper.

  <p>
  <h3>'The Kind of Poetry I Want' by N.H. </h3>
  Drowsy

  <br>like when you take
  <br>a few co-codomols and then

  <h2>A POEM ABOUT A QUIRKY HAGGERSTON CAFE</h2>

  <p>
    I visited this cafe with an ex a number of times. He's obsessed with Cappacino (a good one more than anything) and I
    wrote this poem in my head whilst watching him so militantly drink this coffee. I'm not sure why I wanted to staple
    him to the wall then?

  <p>
  <h3>'Shed' by N.H. </h3>

  Coffee. A necessity for most,
  <br>for you, a sip of any caffeinated concoction—
  <br>cappuccino, for example,
  <br>transports a militant like solace to your entirety.
  <p>
    When its foamy froth brushes against your lips,
    <br>cloaks your moustache with iridescent shades of
    <br>orange, you sensually quiver. This is precisely the
    <br>moment you have obediently waited for all week.
  <p>
    And so, as you sit in the copper lit space
    <br>of The Shed, you utter discourse on those
    <br>voyages you and your companions have undertaken
    <br>along the slimy stretch of land you routinely trot along.
  <p>
    I hit pause on your mouth, briefly:
    <br>an image of you strolling comes to mind, O
    <br>keen flaneur, look how you absorb the mayhem of
    <br>Saturday mornings in the city you have made your home!
  <p>
    The sickening pace of futuristic London
    <br>so medieval yet some utopian hub where
    <br>idlers like you can forgo some revolutionary
    <br>self-realisation, that urban space is essential for self-evolution.
  <p>
    I now resume you, glare at how you
    <br>clutch the smooth paper cup that consumes
    <br>the breadth of your ivory hand,
    <br>coastal hands that have endured stormy
  <p>
    attacks from the sea that enriched your essence.
    <br>
    <br>How is it then, that this replica of some industrial
    <br>hub, once home to some scrawny flunkey, has become
    <br>our underground bunker? Some desolate building on
    <br>face-value, upon
  <p>
    Closer inspection, down those steep stairs
    <br>splotched with remnants of an unknown strain
    <br>of coffee, we find ourselves in a capsule tainted
    <br>with neon flames bolted on its ceilings.
  <p>
    The mismatched aesthetic of modernity remains at odds with
    <br>fragments of life from up North here. Meanwhile we
    <br>sink, recline back on those finely stitched sofas,
    <br>a shade of what appears to be a mesh of blue and grey,
  <p>
    complimented by the sterile walls that shadow the room, I
    <br>fight the uncontrollable desire to lift you from that seat,
    <br>unkink you from my snotty embrace, staple you to the bare skin of those
    <br>clinical walls so that your settlement, on that exact spot,
  <p>
    Would gleam, like the foamy froth that has claimed its residence
    <br>on the top of your lip.

     <h2>MY FIRST PANDEMIC POEM</h2>
<p>
    This was one of the first poems I wrote relating to the pandemic. The title of this poem is an allusion to ‘Worm Moon’ in Twelve Moons by Mary Oliver.
<p>
  <h3>"In March the Earth remembers its own name" by N.H. </h3>


Remembrance is only enacted by the weak.
<br>Those who wish to recall a
<br>
<br>Distant past, a history laden with blinding
<br>projections of modernity.
<br>
<br>This March is toiled by the intrusion of 
<br>a bewildering guest.
<br>
<br>This March must declare temporary insanity,  
<br>halt any reunion with its love child, Bloom.
<br>
<br>This March must not remember its own name,
<br>should re-enact the mannerisms of its forefathers—
<br>
<br>January, to exemplify—mimic its icy enmity
<br>pretermit its own identity, 
<br>
<br>Freeze its yearly task to blush the earth’s bosoms
<br>and engage in open fire with the invisible. 


     <h2>LARKIN LOVE</h2>

<p>
    This poem was inspired by Philip Larkin's 'Coming'. The poem looks towards the future and anticipates change as Spring is on the horizons.
<p>
  <h3> 'The Hill' by N.H. </h3>


It is finally spring and I, whose adulthood comprises<br>
of continuous bustle, will now<br>
lay on the peak of a hill,<br> 
open a book for the sake of opening it,<br>
smile at passers-by with pets,<br>
observe lovers holding hands,<br>
admire the skyline of skyscrapers<br>
and begin to feel happy, again.<br>  


<h2>GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT MY BROKEN HOME </h2>

<p>
    Family means everything to me. I love my family. I love my home, but it is a broken one. For the last ten years we have been disconnected from the reality of one another. We exist peacefully under one roof but each of us remain haunted by the series of events over the last decade.
    <br>
    <br>Instead, we pretend and overwhelm our routines and daily life so to avoid, one another and that year everything fell apart.
<p>
  <h3> 'Ugly Home' by N.H. </h3>


Ugly home—<br>  
I curse you and the god of divorce,<br>  
your botched brown furniture<br>  
like Mrs Kitch’s rhinoplasty,<br>  
the insincere stench of family<br>   
you omit<br>  
in each of your rooms,<br>   
<br>  
villages of terror<br>  
occupied by four glum offspring,<br>  
those descendants of the Maniae clan<br>  
who wither in abandon.<br>  
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
how I would love to see you disintegrate,<br>  
rupture in half, like Usher<br>  
or burn like that place called hell those radicals keep warning us about.<br>  
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
your failures<br>  
char my form.<br>   
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
to be ugly is one thing—<br>  
but to rescind water from the pipes in your arms,<br>  
for those villages you shelter<br>  
is simply cruel.<br>   


  <h3> 'Noah's Ark' by N.H. </h3>

Hot pink duffle on my side<br>
swings<br>
with every step I take.<br>
<br>
I walk these ghost streets<br>
alone<br>
with all absent, I<br>
<br>
Wonder whether this pandemic will wipe us<br> 
like the grand flood that destroyed<br> 
the naive in Noah’s time.<br>
<br>
Desperate for answers, I<br> 
attempt to lure the distracted Pussens away from her expedition<br>
<br>
My human tongue fails to register inside her cobbled brain.<br> 
<br>
Broken household appliances, and those references to my broken nose<br>
I can withstand<br>
<br>
Flooded pillows, a dim spirit and the constant desire to murder that unrecognisable child<br> in the ragged photo you pointed to and told me was the happiest day of my infancy,<br>
I can no longer tolerate.<br>
<br>
This was supposed to be our ark,<br>
a safe haven for those broken promises of our childhood,<br>
<br>
Now it overflows with contaminated water that seeps from your pipes.

  <h2>LONGING FOR THE RUSH OF A COMMUTE AGAIN</h2>

<p>
   From my university days, I enjoyed the most walking up and down Waterloo Bridge trying to out pace commuters in the mornings and the evenings. I am a competitve person and there is something dangerously addicting about trying to out walk another eager commuter. 
   <br>
   It makes me sad now that we will never experience the rush hour commute in the same way we used to before Covid...
<p>
  <h3> 'Waterloo' by N.H. </h3>

Waterloo, I remember your<br>
congested bridge<br>
crammed with commuters—<br>
The moment I first touched you, 4 years ago<br>
and ran your lengths.<br> 
<br>
Waterloo, I see you<br>
on my screen,<br>
Now vacant, you long for<br>
the brisk footsteps of strangers,<br>
trotting your ground.<br>
<br>
Waterloo, I have become you<br>
on your emptiest of days,<br>
Craving the rush of strangers,<br> 
on this bridge, a bar or<br> 
a hotel.<br> 


<h2>THE REALITY OF POST CHRISTMAS BLUES </h2>

<p>
    There is something haunting about the month of January. The build up to Christmas and then, the anti-climactic countodwn until the New Year... January almost feels haunted in and of its self. 
    <br>
    <br>It is the beginning of something. We project optimistic results for the remainder of the year and set ourselves up for eventual dissapointment-- whether this is a concious decision or not.
<p>
  <h3> 'January' by N.H. </h3>


Mass graves of hair follicles congregate<br>
militantly inside your strawberry seeded legs.<br>
Knees crossed, firmly pressed against your murmuring chest.<br>
If you wept, it would amount to a droplet in the Pacific. <br>
<br>
The water serves to console you on a day like today;<br>
Its sweltering heat, like a disposable foil blanket tingles<br>
over you after hours of distress, false pretense. <br>
<br>
Such circumstances I dare not judge.<br>
<br>
Tell me, if I free the bath plug from its nest,<br> 
Would you unravel, find another make-shift sanctuary,<br>  
bury yourself someplace you know best will not be of value<br> 
to you and weep like a bauble in January who knows his time is up?<br>

<h2>I KISSED HIS FROZEN LIPS BUT I COULD STILL NOT COMPREHEND THAT HE WAS DEAD </h2>

<p>
    I lost someone important to me August 2019. I think it is the most devestating thing I have yet to experience in that, it made the biggest dent in my perspective of life and living.
    <br>
    <br>This poem is a stream of conciousness, it doesn't make a lot of sense because the event itself did not and still does not make sense to me. It features my last encounter with him when he was alive and my last encounter of him when he was dead inside his casket, both alone and cold.
<p>
  <h3> 'Rise' by N.H. </h3>

eager legs<br>
carried<br>
me<br>
to you<br>
they didn’t let me see you<br>
in the house<br>
our final meeting<br> 
was<br>
the basement<br>
inside the mosque,<br> 
you have now prompted me to loathe<br>
i remember you<br>
tucked inside that shiny black thing<br>
sunken in your eternal bed<br>
layers of white cloth<br>
nauseatingly bleached<br>
set against your once<br> 
black skin<br>
now yellow<br>
or grey<br>
your eyes permanently fastened<br>
shut<br>
i moved closer<br> 
blemished your polished<br> 
face<br>
with my murky tears<br>
fountain of grief<br>
pouring<br>
coats of mascara<br>
falling on you<br>
my summer lips<br>
touched your glacial head<br>
the last thing you said to me:<br>
thank you for coming<br>
i wish you could<br>
rise,<br>
crawl out of that box<br>
thank me<br> 
again<br>
one more time<br>
for visiting<br> 
then<br> 
take my hand<br> 
sing our song<br>
make loops<br> 
around my palm<br>
stopover my wrists<br>
greet my bony arm<br>
home is:<br>
your hand, placed<br> 
inside my underarm<br>
there:<br>
the voyage ends.<br>

<h2>WHY I NO LONGER GO ON RUNS AS A DATE </h2>
    We were getting ready for a run as a date activity one Sunday morning last year and he was telling me childhood stories about his dead father.<br>
    <br> Whilst he was telling me these stories, I laid there fighting an internal battle about our visibly and notably significant age gap.<br> 
    <br> I recall quickly stuffing these anxities about our age gap somewhere at the back of my mind, throwing myself further into the whirl and naviety of our relationship and began stretching in preparation for our run.

<h2> PREGNANT AGAIN WITH TH' OLD TWINS, HOPE AND FEAR </h2>

    This essay is about Absence in Early Modern correspondences. It features a discussion on absense and some accompanying analysis of John Donne and Ovid.
    <br>

  <h3> A discussion of absence and the conversational in Early Modern Letters by N.H. </h3>
<i>A letter is a conversation between two absent friends</i> - Erasmus<br>
<p>
The epistle composed in the wake of absence, does not, as Erasmus suggests, offer a ‘conversation’. Parting ways with Erasmus’s definition of the letter, I contend that we do not encounter a ‘conversation’ as such: the verb conversation suggests an interchange, one which is absent in Ovid’s “Heroides” and John Donne’s “To Mr. T.W”.  These letters exhibit the oft one-sided nature of the epistolary genre: Ovid and Donne convey the ways in which letters are an attempt at conversation, suggesting the composition of the epistle itself is a strategy to create colloquy. 
<br>
<br>Ovid’s “Heroides” is a unique case study, showcasing the poet’s originality constructing verse letters in the elegiac form.  Albert R. Baca in “Ovid's Claim to Originality and Heroides 1” provides a useful argument which I will utilise to discuss the way the letter is an attempt – not that it is – a[t] conversation.  Heroides I, introduces the epistolary genre, ‘these words, dear slow Ulysses, Penelope dispatches; never mind the favour of your reply’.  The theme of absence is established from the offset, with Ovid choosing this letter as the introduction to his verse letters, I suggest, centrality is placed on absence, its physical and epistolary affect. The physical absence of Ulysses is depicted by Ovid to induce a certain pscyho-dramatic effect on Penelope, one that is gendered and exposes Ovid’s ‘unique psychological sensitivity’ to the woes of his female subjects.  The gendered aspect of the “Heroides” is further discussed by Roland Barthes, ‘the discourse of absence is carried on by the woman’.  It is not only transported by the woman as Barthes suggests, but furthermore, perpetuated by the lack of response – ‘the confrontation with an always absent you’.
<br>
<br>In “Heroides”, Penelope refers to her gender exhaustively: ‘I am a mere woman’, ‘a powerless wife’, ‘have pity on the woman you used to love’, ‘rustic wife’, exposing her vulnerability as a woman.  Though Ovid champions his heroines by giving them the means to express their woes, his heroines succumb to a lesser form of self-expression. Their mannerisms illustrate the dramatic, bodily effects of absence: ‘my panic returned, refreshed and revived’, ‘my heart was gripped in icy fears’.  These dramatizations for Linda Kauffman are ‘rhetorical strategies’, particularly in the case of Dido where the threat of suicide is deployed to ‘persuade Aeneas to return’.  I am not convinced that these dramatizations are entirely ‘rhetorical strategies’. Instead, the dramatizations we encounter are in fact realisations, epiphanies even, which convey an understanding of the letter being unable to bridge the gap between the absent and present. Leander writes of this: ‘you will read with regretful eyes these words of mine on a mute page’. The letter is not a conversation as Erasmus suggests nor is it ‘just what my conversation would be if you and I were sitting in one another’s company or taking walks together’ as Seneca dwells upon in Moral Epistles 75.  Instead, the letters of each heroine is fundamentally mute as it is unable to make up for the absence of her lover. Thus, it is right for Sara Lindheim to suggest the part failure of the epistle for Ovid’s heroines, in that each ‘heroine highlights the variety of ways in which her own epistle fails to erase the divide’ that absence further perpetuates.
<br>
<br>Similar to the ways Ovid charts the bodily effects of absence, Donne begins his letter to Woodward with the declaration, ‘pregnant again with th’ old twins Hope and Fear’.  There are two significant things to point out here. First, we encounter a similar marker of time like the opening of Heroides I: the adjective ‘old’ presents an immediate juxtaposition to the status of pregnancy. The analogy to pregnancy is furthermore oxymoronic: ‘Hope and Fear’ exhibit the emotions which run heavy throughout the poem much owed to the absence of a response. Ramie Targoff in “John Donne, Body and Soul” describes this opening as a ‘state of epistolary expectation’.  I concur with this proposition as the expectation of a response is positioned at the center of this speaker’s anatomy, the stomach.  The use of the phrase ‘again’ indicates the exhaustive attempts at a receiving a response, charting the speaker’s familiarity with being at the receiving end of – nothing. Moreover, the poems use of rhyming triplets and couplets presents a false sense of togetherness and, of reciprocity, both of which are absent in this correspondence. Yet the epistolary form, for Donne, ‘mingle[s] soul[s] by standing as a material object which ‘friends absent speak’.  Though the power of the letter is its ability to ‘mingle soul[s]’, I do not fully agree that it permits a conversation. The only fragment of a conversation we encounter in this poem is when ‘the body ris’n’ upon receiving a correspondence and even this experience is short lived.  The state of ‘epistolary expectation’ is still present at the end of the poem as Donne’s speaker is not satisfied by the response he receives. What emerges at the end is the metaphor of the banquet, standing as an illustration of the unsatisfying letter he receives, and an epiphany: sometimes, no response is better than a response.

<h2>DEAR DIARY SERIES</h2>

  <h3>Wednesday 6th June 2018, 4PM</h3>
  <h4>BRIGHTON</h4>

  I am in Brighton! I think I really needed this day to clear my mind and just think.
<p>
  I am watching the tide come in and I just want to get up and walk into the water. I want the water to take me. Hold me under the caresses of her waves. The water is the only one I want.
<p>
  I have been battling with these thoughts the past few days extremely. I feel this extreme sense of violation and loneliness. It is a really shit feeling. I use music to cope with these feelings - but the truth is music is a mere 4 minute escape from the wraths of my life.
<p>
  I can feel the wind that is being brought in by the tide closing in. It is quite cold. The tide closing in reminds me of the bliss closing in on me. The few bliss(es) I have in my life. I am scared that I won't be able to do anything about it. Everyone I have is leaving me. I am just pissed that this was what I had anticipated. Meet a few rare people -  enjoy them - they leave. It is the circle of my god damn life. Sometimes I scream silently, 'GO, GO, GO, GO and LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE'. Be fucking gone. But others, I cry, to myself (of course), 'Please don't leave me, hug me tight, kiss me, hold me, tell me everything will be ok'. But this shit only happens in the movies. And if my life is indeed a movie - it is for sure a damned horror movie.
<p>
  Anyways, Brighton, you were good to me. Thank you. I needed you. Tell the water I will be back next time, ready to take her embrace. For now, I'll live.


  <h3>JOURNALS OF A PANDEMIC</h3>
  <p>
    I think everyone is well aware of the fact that we are almost one year into the pandemic. At the beginning of the
    pandemic, I collaborated in a writing project where writers were prompted to share think pieces as they attempted to
    navigate this new reality.
  <p>
    I am going to dedicate this section to sharing a few of the pieces I've written and how strange it seems that this was
    several months ago. Has anything changed between then and now? Not much. But something has changed and it's useful for
    me to analyse my thought processes from this bleak time in my life.

  <p>

  <h3>Wednesday 22nd April 2020, 4PM</h3>
  <h4>IF YOU KNOW ME, NO YOU DO NOT</h4>


Those who know me, know that I enjoy the work of T.S. Eliot. In particular, they know, I routinely turn to ‘The Waste Land’, shoehorning the oft quoted opening section in ‘The Fire Sermon’ in often, awkward, places. I also quoted Eliot in one of my first diary entries for this journal on Tuesday, 31st March. 
<p>I recently read a book by Matthew Hart where he forges a connection between the work of Eliot and Caribbean poet historian, Kamau Brathwaite. Hart links Eliot’s emphasis on sound configurations with Braithwaite’s, claiming the auditory emphasis, the focus on voice in European modernism intersects, unusually with Caribbean poetry. I am no Hart, nor a theorist, or even a scholar pertaining to the world literature by any regard, but it is this emphasis of voice, of voices overlapping and intersecting – even in the most unusual of places – that has always drawn me to experimental poetry. 
<p>Today, I find myself researching the legality surrounding declaring my mother incompetent to make sound medical decisions. I cannot help but turn to Eliot, as I am confronted by my mother’s deteriorating mental and physical health. I find a strange, albeit comforting solace in the voices that emerge in ‘The Waste Land’, prompting me to dwell on a series of what-ifs and how-tos. 
<p>In a dark way, I see much of Eliot’s first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, in my mother. A quick Google search will tell you that Vivienne and Eliot met in not so unusual ways, a spring-time event in London. Most Eliot-critics tend to carry a discourse where Haigh-Wood is portrayed as some crazed stalker, infatuated and obsessed with successful Eliot following their divorce which was as a result of sheer incompatibility. In short, Haigh-Wood’s mental health deteriorated quite rapidly after her divorce, though the onset to this was her marriage. Committed to an asylum by her brother around 1938, Haigh-Wood, like many women in her predicament whom had found themselves in asylums that had the opposite effect of its intent, further deteriorated in her sentence. 9 years later, Haigh-Wood, dead. Overdose. 
<p>I often think about how my parents met; two first-generation immigrants fleeing war-torn Africa, constructing an unstable path of success. Like Haigh-Wood and Eliot, their paths crossed in London. In 1994, my mum was at least 8 years into living with her disease which was diagnosed by medical professionals in Kenya, a country she sought refuge during her migration. By the time she met my father in a shabby London hotel, where they both worked as cleaners, she had separated from a mysterious figure whom she was married to for less than a year. My parents, upon meeting, formed a network, an alliance with migrants from her home country whom were all in their twenties, optimistic about life in this great city. My parents and their group of friends, whom I bump into occasionally in the community, loved and appreciated London in ineffable ways, journeying its streets with pride and gratitude, thankful for this opportunity to have a –real—chance at life, a chance many of their families and friends back home would never experience. London was their Hail Mary. 
<p>I am guilty of looking at their dusty photo albums from the 90s, with a feeling in many ways, akin to jealously. Though I think jealous may be too strong of a word, I envy their courage—their naïve optimism. I am advantaged to have been born here, to not have to endure crossing borders and travelling across continents for my immediate safety. I think, I wish I had a Hail Mary, one that would enable me to construct a new home, a new sense of identity and permit forging life-long bonds in my early 20’s. 
<p>My parents married at the beginning of 1996. Though tribally dissimilar, they were admired by their friends and their marriage was celebrated within their entire ethnic community. These newlyweds lived in small flat and whilst raising nieces. An unusual start to a new chapter, my parents embarked on their responsibilities as parents to children whom weren’t their own. In December 1996, my mother prematurely went into labour with a son at only 24 weeks and fought for her life in hospital whilst her son remained in intensive care. Her son, fought for 4 months, tubed and sedated until the hospital deemed him healthy. With no complications, her son was a miracle and my mother survived the complications of childbirth alongside her disease. Another Hail Mary. 
<p>Across the span of 9 years, my mother bore 4 children, though had lost a few owed to miscarriages. I do not recall much of my mother for the first decade of my life. It all seems a blur. I tried psychotherapy for many years, alongside other forms of counselling to help me unpack these foggy years. I did not have a traumatic childhood by no means. Photo-albums, testimonies from family members and my cousins, who claim an envy of my childhood, have enabled me to determine this fact. It was only when my parents’ marriage disintegrated, aged 11, that I began to capture and recall vividly, every interaction with my mother. 
<p>A short while ago, following my mother’s relapse that almost saw her dead, my father hinted at the burden he carried for over a decade with her condition. The speed which I am typically able to process trauma is often delayed, yet in that moment, I felt an instant rush of resentment flow through me towards my father. I deemed him a co-conspirer in my mother’s current incompetency. 
<p>I write this with the memory of me and my siblings huddled in our living room, the two silver chandeliers witnessing our rushed attempts to pump her body with drugs to counteract her body’s desire to fall into an unconscious state. My mother is a high-risk for catching and frankly, dying from Coronavirus. She has been indoors for the last 6 weeks. In these 6 weeks, I have observed a series of relapses, notwithstanding a clear image that captures the decline of a woman whom her inner circle of migrant friends describe as the light of the group
<p>But, said 6 weeks of social distancing and quarantining in our home are mere minutes in comparison to the torture I have witnessed my mother inflict upon herself owed to the departure of her husband. Heartbreak, shame, fear: three not-so-invisible forces that have cast her life in an eerie darkness, a darkness that has blinded her to the extent she regularly ditches life dependent medication which she has been taking for 30 years, in favour of holistic medicine prescribed by questionable internet sources. 
<p>Whilst the world battles the invisible, I too, battle the invisible wrath of my mother’s disease and herself. I refuse, in part, to be like my father –a co-conspirator to her incompetency. Perhaps my mother is ‘“the hyacinth girl”’ Eliot writes of in ‘A Game of Chess’, ‘neither living nor dead’, zigzagging along the now withered path she forged in her early 20’s, unable to comprehend the loss of her husband and the life they naively built – then wrecked – together. 
<p>As my many internal voices intersect and bellow in unusual ways at the boxed-up memories I have supressed from these years and my current predicament, I end this piece with two voices that are at friction with one another in ‘The Waste Land’. These voices, hauntingly having the ability to capture the tense conversations with my mother during her periods of deterioration, highly likely to be the voices of Eliot and Haigh-Wood as they navigate their chafing marriage:
<p>
“My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.<br>
“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.<br>
  “What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?<br>
“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”<br>
<br>
  I think we are in rats’ alley<br>
Where the dead men lost their bones.<br>
<br>
  “What is that noise?”<br>
                          The wind under the door.<br>
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”<br>
                           Nothing again nothing.<br>
<br>                                                        “Do<br>
“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember<br>
“Nothing?”<br>
<br>
       I remember<br>
Those are pearls that were his eyes.<br>
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”<br>   
<p>I end this piece with just that. An extract, vague as it is self-explanatory. I too, am unable to find anything in my head.

  <h4>OUTSIDE</h4>

  It happened in the blink of an eye. Me and R were engrossed in conversation, enjoying the fresh sunset on some road in
  the De Beauvoir area, then it happened.

  <p> And it was all very strange.
  <p> This man came whizzing down the road, at an extraordinary speed, on his electric scooter. But this wasn’t it.
    Parallel to him was a dog. Not an ordinary, doe-eyed fluffy dog; a very big, dark brown dog with a red ball firmly
    grounded in his teeth.
  <p> Now usually, I wouldn’t be so mind blown by an encounter with a fierce-looking dog. However, as it came closer and
    closer towards me, I panicked. R panicked too. I recall mumbling under my breath, ‘just keep walking, just keep
    walking’ as if to convince myself standing half paralysed on the pavement would somehow encourage the dog to leap onto
    me.
  <p> So, I listened to my inner voice. I kept on walking, timidly, might I add. R stood behind me. I don’t know whether
    he stopped walking or not, but he was no longer next to me. After this very odd, brief encounter, I think what I
    wanted more than anything in that given moment, was to urinate.
  <p> Was it fear that made my bladder suddenly have the urge to release its contents? Or was it that bottle of Lucozade I
    consumed with the fries R bought me?
  <p> Fear is a funny thing. I don’t think I have ever felt fear to the same extent as I had yesterday. And for what it is
    worth, I am a pretty fearful person. I put my hand to my bare chest at random moments during the night just to make
    sure that my heart is beating. Even though, I know it is, otherwise I wouldn’t have the ability to bring my hand to my
    chest. I have dreams sometimes about dead family members so I prompt myself the next morning to contact random family
    members I have left; those whom I haven’t picked up their calls in a while, just to make sure that they are alive and
    of course, to subside the occasional guilt I feel for being bad at checking-in on people.
  <p> Even after a few moments R and I overcame the initial shock at what just happened, I made sure to clutch his fingers
    a little tighter, though as sticky with sweat they may have been, I didn’t care. I needed some relief to ease off this
    state I was in.
  <p> I have been hearing non-stop over the last couple of months, this fear we have all developed as collective over the
    invisible. But yesterday’s events have led me to think that we should fear the very visible, the most. Those things
    that leap out in front of us when we least expect it: the tangible, physical, actual objects, people, animals,
    substances, money, the night sky—these, we should fear the most. Not because, we enjoy the physical and mental effects
    of fear, but rather, the ability fear has to startle, shake and inspire us to pick up the pen and write diary entries
    about them.

  <h3>Saturday 30th May 2020, 4PM</h3>
  <h4>INSIDE</h4>

  I’ve written extensively over the last few years about locked rooms and spaces. I have reflected optimistically on the
  benefits of a nurturing domestic space for the intellectual mind in Edgar Allen Poe’s ‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue’.
  At the same time, I have written on domestic spaces that do the very opposite of nurturing. In Virginia Woolf’s ‘Jacob’s
  Room’, the novel ends inside the protagonist’s room. The protagonist dead, the room claustrophobically depressing, the
  discordant sounds of a post-war London encroach the domestic space rather perversely.

  <p> I think Woolf’s representation of space in the ending of ‘Jacob’s Room’ aptly fits my relationship to the indoors.
    During the lockdown, I decided to move into one of the rooms downstairs. I excitedly transformed the room into my own,
    personal space, glad at the prospect of starting afresh and creating a space that would help me navigate this odd
    period.
  <p> It’s been exactly 2 months since I moved into my new space and I think that this space has failed me. It is
    hauntingly white. Every single wall in here is white. The doors too are all white. My desk, bookcase, wardrobe – all
    white. My curtains, a mixture of cream and white. My bedsheets, pillowcases and duvet – yes, all white. I am probably
    the only thing of colour that is furnished in this room.
  <p> The room has failed me, not because it is very much lifeless. Rather, it has failed to offer me the comfort and
    reassurance, I naively thought it would. Much like Jacob’s room, the outside world very much encroaches this space.
  <p> I struggle, on all but a few days to get out of this room. I work my 8-hour workday in my bed. I eat my meals also,
    on my bed. I read, write, watch, all on my bed. Every single boundary I had formerly set up between the different
    aspects of my life have collapsed inside this very room.
  <p> Attempting to reconstruct these boundaries, I have since learned, is one hundred percent futile. Everything I need
    to do, has to be done here. In this room. I’ve ventured off to the garden a couple of times, but with the blaring heat
    and blinding sunshine, this venture is counterproductive and leaves me feeling frustrated and defeated.
  <p> As I catch up with local and world news daily, those collapsed boundaries further dissolve in my domestic and
    psychological space. I sink further into an overwhelming state of annoyance and claustrophobia. Who will free me?
    Boris? A vaccine? Myself? My favourite poem? Glimpses of my lover?
  <p> There is no resolve.

  <p>
  <h3>Saturday 6th June 2020, 1PM</h3>
  <h4>NO LONGER HOME</h4>

  I have moved to a different location. Living in someone else’s home comes with a weird discomfort. Not so much a
  physical discomfort but this feeling that you are an intruder; tiptoeing to the bathroom, gently closing cabinets,
  making sure that you are not heard because you fear that you will annoy people and they will eventually dislike your
  presence in their sanctuary.

  <p> The last week has given me a boost of confidence, nonetheless. I feel happier, though I am a sceptic and believe
    that this will soon end. It has been freeing to move away from my family home and the confines of my bedroom that has
    had its invisible hand firmly pressed around my neck over the last few months.
  <p> It is eerily quiet here. A confusing reality in comparison to my rowdy household. My cousins both work remotely in
    their rooms and are unseen for the majority of the day. The only noise that is somewhat an annoyance is the music that
    comes from their housemate’ room. Yesterday, she listened to a rendition of the American National anthem for the
    entire day. On repeat. When I asked her if she knew the origins of this anthem, she spoke in her native tongue and
    told me ‘No’. She likes the voice of the woman who sings it. There is an innocence in simply, not knowing.
  <p> Most of my belongings are not here. My diffuser is not here. That annoying diffuser, I miss. I could, get it from my
    family home very easily. But I am lazy. So, I will complain internally since I do not have it here with me. The
    diffuser isn’t so silent as it was advertised. It makes a strange hissing sound and growls whenever the water levels
    are low. In spite of this, I love it. It came with various oils and depending on my mood, I could choose a scent to
    match it. The room I am staying in has a lingering smell of cigarettes. It is quite the scent; warming but harsh. It
    is a humbling, forceful scent. Even the breeze fails to defeat it.
  <p> Just last night, I almost cried with joy because my cousin had the same model toothbrush as me. This meant that I
    could charge my dead toothbrush and enjoy its awakening vibrations on my teeth. Like the diffuser, I could easily
    bring it here. But like I said before, I am lazy.

  <p>
  <h3>Sunday 28th June 2020, 6PM</h3>
  <h4>MENSTRUAL CYCLE MAYHEM</h4>

  It is around the time that my menstrual period is due, and I am yet again feeling quite on edge.

  <p> My life over the last few weeks has felt like fragments of a Sally Rooney novel burned onto a CD mix of garage rave
    anthems. There have been many highs: I have met new people, I have gone on adventures I never thought I could have,
    felt things I have never felt before. During the last few weeks, I also (re)discovered that I hate my job, lost the
    motivation to write, neglected my embroidery project and lost my glasses.
  <p> Seems trivial at glance—but losing my glasses was the cherry on top and threw me off a psychological edge. It was
    that final straw that made me feel a whole new level of defeat. I contacted the few cab drivers I had the night prior
    to ‘see’ if they could locate my glasses. No luck. One driver gave me a callback and attempted to reassure me that it
    would be fine, people have lost more significant items at the back of a cab on a Friday night. I ended up crying after
    that phone call both angry and humiliated at my ability to lose something so important.
  <p> I ended up picking up my new pair of glasses and a batch of contact lenses just yesterday. I was ecstatic. That
    morning I (re)wrote a love letter and posted it, picked up a can of Red Bull to refuel and felt victorious, as if I
    had defeated this feeling of being defeated for being, quite simply, a clunk. I hopped on the 68 to Strand and picked
    them up in this high. The optometrist adjusted the fit for me and we both laughed, reminiscing the many breakdowns I
    had in that store over spectacles and my deteriorating vision.
  <p> I recall leaving the store feeling both elated and relieved. It was going to be a good day. I strolled over to the
    Pret down the road and mumbled under my mask: “An oat vanilla latte please.” There was a man in army uniform standing
    next to me waiting for his batched order and I wondered whether members of the Army are as structured and disciplined
    as people speculate. I remember being transported to a time I half completed my application to join the army. I
    giggled under my mask wondering how catastrophically embarrassing that would have turned out.
  <p> With my coffee in my hand, I strolled out like a cat, into the local Tesco’s and stocked up on sanitary towels,
    Ibuprofen, Paracetamol; preparing myself for my upcoming period. I decided to walk down Waterloo Bridge and take the
    scenic route; contemplate and enjoy my coffee before boarding the bus.
  <p> I think it took all but 3 minutes for this glee to diminish. It started very aggressively raining and gusty winds
    soon followed. I realised I had no umbrella, flats on and that I was carrying a paper bag stuffed with all my items.
    There was no turning back: it took 7 minutes for me to walk down the bridge and when I got to the end, my bag was torn
    to pieces because of the rain and my coffee had turned cold, the paper cup itself turning a greyish hue due to the
    water. I chugged the coffee as soon as I got to the bus stop shelter and firmly pressed my torn apart bag against my
    chest. Why did I prematurely think that my day was going to be good? And why don’t positive affirmations ever work for
    me?
  <p> I went home, pissed. I returned feeling even more defeated I had felt the days prior. I sit here still feeling
    defeated, all the while somehow content. My vagina throbs, out of pain and I am cramping sporadically. Now, I wait for
    this period to come (then go) and for my state of mind to return to its ‘normal’ pre-hormonal phase. I will try not to
    drink too much wine and instead soak up my anxiety about the upcoming working week.
