  <h2>MACDIARMID AND THE KIND OF POETRY I WANT</h2>

  <p>
    People often ask me the type of poetry I like and the answer to that is extremely long winded. In short, I don't know
    what my 'type' is. All I know is that when I read poetry I am looking for one thing and one thing only: to feel a
    specific <i>type</i> of way.

  <p>
    I recently studied the intersectinality between poetry and politics (which I suggest you all do) and in this learing
    process discovered Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid. Now MacDiarmid was an interesting man; he grew up in rural Scotland
    and his life was very surrounded by mills and the machinery of labour. He eventually contributed to founding the
    National Party of Scotland, was a member of the Communist party and was deemed a Communist Sympathiser according to
    Briitsh intelligency agencies. Interestingly, MacDiarmid was expelled from both the National Party of Scotland and
    eventually the Communist Party on multiple occassion. To say he was controversial and eclectic is an understatement.
  <p>

    For many who know me, one of my greatest loves is the love of modernist literature. I love Joyce and his obsession
    with cats. I think of Eliot when the unreality of reality is overwhelming. My appreciation for the simplicity of
    material object is much owed to Williams. I can drunkenly recite Pound from memory at parties with strange men just so
    they know that I am serious about my writing. Why this is important to mention in relation to MacDiarmid is that as
    distant from the modernism movement he was, in a strange way, he was connected to and took inspiration from this
    movement.

  <p>
    MacDiarmid's first works were published in 1923, a year after Joyce, Eliot and Williams. MacDiarmid wrote <i>The Kind
    of Poetry I Want</i> later in his life (1961) and this work of poetry contains fragments of modernism overlayed with
    the politics that overshadowed much of his life.

  <p>
    Here is an extract from MacDiarmid's <i>The Kind of Poetry I Want</i> which you can see his focus on the internal
    structure and the bodily composition of materials:
  <p>

    <i>A poetry that never for a moment forgets
      <br>That if we study the position of the foetus
      <br>As it appears in about the ninth month
      <br>Of its development, we see the tiny body
      <br>Curled up with its head bowed over,
      <br>The hands crossed, and the knees drawn up
      <br>To permit the whole structure
      <br>Of bones, muscles, nerves
      <br>And arteries to fit comfortably
      <br>Into the cage or matrix.</i>

  <p>
    From being inspired by MacDiarmid, I thought to put down in writing what kind of poetry I wanted or at least my
    expectations from poetry. I opted for a short poem with allusions to <i> The Waste Land </i> of course. My intention
    here wasn't to write a poem that features drugs and substance abuse but instead to suggest that poetry is dangerous
    and the parameters of a poem itself is like skirting the edge of a skyscraper.

  <h3>'The Kind of Poetry I Want' by N.H. </h3>
  Drowsy
  <br>lightheaded
  <br>like when you take
  <br>a few co-codomols and then
  <br>swish
  <br>some of that brown drink
  <br>I think
  <br>I would like poetry to be
  <br>like that
  <br>unsafe
  <br>could potentially kill you
  <br>drop a
  <br>bomb

  <h2>A POEM ABOUT A QUIRKY HAGGERSTON CAFE</h2>

  <p>
    I visited this cafe with an ex a number of times. He's obsessed with Cappacino (a good one more than anything) and I
    wrote this poem in my head whilst watching him so militantly drink this coffee. I'm not sure why I wanted to staple
    him to the wall then?

  <p>
  <h3>'Shed' by N.H. </h3>

  Coffee. A necessity for most,
  <br>for you, a sip of any caffeinated concoction—
  <br>cappuccino, for example,
  <br>transports a militant like solace to your entirety.
  <p>
    When its foamy froth brushes against your lips,
    <br>cloaks your moustache with iridescent shades of
    <br>orange, you sensually quiver. This is precisely the
    <br>moment you have obediently waited for all week.
  <p>
    And so, as you sit in the copper lit space
    <br>of The Shed, you utter discourse on those
    <br>voyages you and your companions have undertaken
    <br>along the slimy stretch of land you routinely trot along.
  <p>
    I hit pause on your mouth, briefly:
    <br>an image of you strolling comes to mind, O
    <br>keen flaneur, look how you absorb the mayhem of
    <br>Saturday mornings in the city you have made your home!
  <p>
    The sickening pace of futuristic London
    <br>so medieval yet some utopian hub where
    <br>idlers like you can forgo some revolutionary
    <br>self-realisation, that urban space is essential for self-evolution.
  <p>
    I now resume you, glare at how you
    <br>clutch the smooth paper cup that consumes
    <br>the breadth of your ivory hand,
    <br>coastal hands that have endured stormy
  <p>
    attacks from the sea that enriched your essence.
    <br>
    <br>How is it then, that this replica of some industrial
    <br>hub, once home to some scrawny flunkey, has become
    <br>our underground bunker? Some desolate building on
    <br>face-value, upon
  <p>
    Closer inspection, down those steep stairs
    <br>splotched with remnants of an unknown strain
    <br>of coffee, we find ourselves in a capsule tainted
    <br>with neon flames bolted on its ceilings.
  <p>
    The mismatched aesthetic of modernity remains at odds with
    <br>fragments of life from up North here. Meanwhile we
    <br>sink, recline back on those finely stitched sofas,
    <br>a shade of what appears to be a mesh of blue and grey,
  <p>
    complimented by the sterile walls that shadow the room, I
    <br>fight the uncontrollable desire to lift you from that seat,
    <br>unkink you from my snotty embrace, staple you to the bare skin of those
    <br>clinical walls so that your settlement, on that exact spot,
  <p>
    Would gleam, like the foamy froth that has claimed its residence
    <br>on the top of your lip.

     <h2>MY FIRST PANDEMIC POEM</h2>
<p>
    This was one of the first poems I wrote relating to the pandemic. The title of this poem is an allusion to ‘Worm Moon’ in Twelve Moons by Mary Oliver.
<p>
  <h3>"In March the Earth remembers its own name" by N.H. </h3>


Remembrance is only enacted by the weak.
<br>Those who wish to recall a
<br>
<br>Distant past, a history laden with blinding
<br>projections of modernity.
<br>
<br>This March is toiled by the intrusion of 
<br>a bewildering guest.
<br>
<br>This March must declare temporary insanity,  
<br>halt any reunion with its love child, Bloom.
<br>
<br>This March must not remember its own name,
<br>should re-enact the mannerisms of its forefathers—
<br>
<br>January, to exemplify—mimic its icy enmity
<br>pretermit its own identity, 
<br>
<br>Freeze its yearly task to blush the earth’s bosoms
<br>and engage in open fire with the invisible. 


     <h2>LARKIN LOVE</h2>

<p>
    This poem was inspired by Philip Larkin's 'Coming'. The poem looks towards the future and anticipates change as Spring is on the horizons.
<p>
  <h3> 'The Hill' by N.H. </h3>


It is finally spring and I, whose adulthood comprises<br>
of continuous bustle, will now<br>
lay on the peak of a hill,<br> 
open a book for the sake of opening it,<br>
smile at passers-by with pets,<br>
observe lovers holding hands,<br>
admire the skyline of skyscrapers<br>
and begin to feel happy, again.<br>  


<h2>GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT MY BROKEN HOME </h2>

<p>
    Family means everything to me. I love my family. I love my home, but it is a broken one. For the last ten years we have been disconnected from the reality of one another. We exist peacefully under one roof but each of us remain haunted by the series of events over the last decade.
    <br>
    <br>Instead, we pretend and overwhelm our routines and daily life so to avoid, one another and that year everything fell apart.
<p>
  <h3> 'Ugly Home' by N.H. </h3>


Ugly home—<br>  
I curse you and the god of divorce,<br>  
your botched brown furniture<br>  
like Mrs Kitch’s rhinoplasty,<br>  
the insincere stench of family<br>   
you omit<br>  
in each of your rooms,<br>   
<br>  
villages of terror<br>  
occupied by four glum offspring,<br>  
those descendants of the Maniae clan<br>  
who wither in abandon.<br>  
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
how I would love to see you disintegrate,<br>  
rupture in half, like Usher<br>  
or burn like that place called hell those radicals keep warning us about.<br>  
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
your failures<br>  
char my form.<br>   
<br>  
Ugly home,<br>  
to be ugly is one thing—<br>  
but to rescind water from the pipes in your arms,<br>  
for those villages you shelter<br>  
is simply cruel.<br>   


  <h3> 'Noah's Ark' by N.H. </h3>

Hot pink duffle on my side<br>
swings<br>
with every step I take.<br>
<br>
I walk these ghost streets<br>
alone<br>
with all absent, I<br>
<br>
Wonder whether this pandemic will wipe us<br> 
like the grand flood that destroyed<br> 
the naive in Noah’s time.<br>
<br>
Desperate for answers, I<br> 
attempt to lure the distracted Pussens away from her expedition<br>
<br>
My human tongue fails to register inside her cobbled brain.<br> 
<br>
Broken household appliances, and those references to my broken nose<br>
I can withstand<br>
<br>
Flooded pillows, a dim spirit and the constant desire to murder that unrecognisable child<br> in the ragged photo you pointed to and told me was the happiest day of my infancy,<br>
I can no longer tolerate.<br>
<br>
This was supposed to be our ark,<br>
a safe haven for those broken promises of our childhood,<br>
<br>
Now it overflows with contaminated water that seeps from your pipes.

  <h2>LONGING FOR THE RUSH OF A COMMUTE AGAIN</h2>

<p>
   From my university days, I enjoyed the most walking up and down Waterloo Bridge trying to out pace commuters in the mornings and the evenings. I am a competitve person and there is something dangerously addicting about trying to out walk another eager commuter. 
   <br>
   It makes me sad now that we will never experience the rush hour commute in the same way we used to before Covid...
<p>
  <h3> 'Waterloo' by N.H. </h3>

Waterloo, I remember your<br>
congested bridge<br>
crammed with commuters—<br>
The moment I first touched you, 4 years ago<br>
and ran your lengths.<br> 
<br>
Waterloo, I see you<br>
on my screen,<br>
Now vacant, you long for<br>
the brisk footsteps of strangers,<br>
trotting your ground.<br>
<br>
Waterloo, I have become you<br>
on your emptiest of days,<br>
Craving the rush of strangers,<br> 
on this bridge, a bar or<br> 
a hotel.<br> 


<h2>THE REALITY OF POST CHRISTMAS BLUES </h2>

<p>
    There is something haunting about the month of January. The build up to Christmas and then, the anti-climactic countodwn until the New Year... January almost feels haunted in and of its self. 
    <br>
    <br>It is the beginning of something. We project optimistic results for the remainder of the year and set ourselves up for eventual dissapointment-- whether this is a concious decision or not.
<p>
  <h3> 'January' by N.H. </h3>


Mass graves of hair follicles congregate<br>
militantly inside your strawberry seeded legs.<br>
Knees crossed, firmly pressed against your murmuring chest.<br>
If you wept, it would amount to a droplet in the Pacific. <br>
<br>
The water serves to console you on a day like today;<br>
Its sweltering heat, like a disposable foil blanket tingles<br>
over you after hours of distress, false pretense. <br>
<br>
Such circumstances I dare not judge.<br>
<br>
Tell me, if I free the bath plug from its nest,<br> 
Would you unravel, find another make-shift sanctuary,<br>  
bury yourself someplace you know best will not be of value<br> 
to you and weep like a bauble in January who knows his time is up?<br>

<h2>I KISSED HIS FROZEN LIPS BUT I COULD STILL NOT COMPREHEND THAT HE WAS DEAD </h2>

<p>
    I lost someone important to me August 2019. I think it is the most devestating thing I have yet to experience in that, it made the biggest dent in my perspective of life and living.
    <br>
    <br>This poem is a stream of conciousness, it doesn't make a lot of sense because the event itself did not and still does not make sense to me. It features my last encounter with him when he was alive and my last encounter of him when he was dead inside his casket, both alone and cold.
<p>
  <h3> 'Rise' by N.H. </h3>

eager legs<br>
carried<br>
me<br>
to you<br>
they didn’t let me see you<br>
in the house<br>
our final meeting<br> 
was<br>
the basement<br>
inside the mosque,<br> 
you have now prompted me to loathe<br>
i remember you<br>
tucked inside that shiny black thing<br>
sunken in your eternal bed<br>
layers of white cloth<br>
nauseatingly bleached<br>
set against your once<br> 
black skin<br>
now yellow<br>
or grey<br>
your eyes permanently fastened<br>
shut<br>
i moved closer<br> 
blemished your polished<br> 
face<br>
with my murky tears<br>
fountain of grief<br>
pouring<br>
coats of mascara<br>
falling on you<br>
my summer lips<br>
touched your glacial head<br>
the last thing you said to me:<br>
thank you for coming<br>
i wish you could<br>
rise,<br>
crawl out of that box<br>
thank me<br> 
again<br>
one more time<br>
for visiting<br> 
then<br> 
take my hand<br> 
sing our song<br>
make loops<br> 
around my palm<br>
stopover my wrists<br>
greet my bony arm<br>
home is:<br>
your hand, placed<br> 
inside my underarm<br>
there:<br>
the voyage ends.<br>

<h2>WHY I NO LONGER GO ON RUNS AS A DATE </h2>
    We were getting ready for a run as a date activity one Sunday morning last year and he was telling me childhood stories about his dead father.<br>
    <br> Whilst he was telling me these stories, I laid there fighting an internal battle about our visibly and notably significant age gap.<br> 
    <br> I recall quickly stuffing these anxities about our age gap somewhere at the back of my mind, throwing myself further into the whirl and naviety of our relationship and began stretching in preparation for our run.

  <h3> 'Before London Fields' by N.H. </h3>

‘When I was 8, my father would take<br>
me camping, teach me how to make<br>
fire…’<br> 
<br>
You’re getting ready for our Sunday run,<br>
wiping your pale body with a shredded<br>
towel. I lay on your bed soaking<br>
up your childhood memories.<br>
<br>
When you were in Hesse, making<br>
fires, I did not exist.<br> 
When you were in Paris and your mother<br> 
called from Holland to say he was dead,<br> 
I was 3, crawling inside a Peckham flat.<br> 
<br>
Yes, I will stay tonight. Lay<br>
on your chest, listen to you tell<br>
stories about how you once made fire<br>
from dead twigs.<br>

  <h3> 'Subtitles to a Japanese Horror Movie' by N.H. </h3>

  Clusters of embryonic bards<br>
huddled inside the womb of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Intrusion,<br> 
in the form of an unexpected<br>
guest<br>
with frenzied feet,<br> 
burning to escape<br>
that small room<br>
where the revelation of your departure was born.<br>
<br>
A sudden urge<br>
to disperse—<br>
flee those optimistic counsellors<br>
whose utterances bounce the walls<br> 
of this charred room,<br>
painted by the tongue of that intruder.<br>
<br>
What to expect when you are not expecting?<br>
<br>
Look, departed enthusiast!<br>
ruptured amnion seeping through blue curtains<br>
for you,<br>
mountains of grief<br> 
form<br>
in<br>
that small room<br>
where the revelation of your departure was born.<br>

<h2> WHY DOES LOOKING AT FAMILY PHOTO-ALBUMS MAKE ME SICK? </h2>

    I can't answer this question. Is it the nostalgia? Is it my former state of innocence? I think I simply miss my naiveity as a toddler-- the not knowing what reality strangely comprises of.
    <br>

  <h3> 'Roots' by N.H. </h3>

Wandering fingers, made me open<br>
your ragged front cover,<br>
a cover that has, for decades<br>
been prodded by fingers of lamenting intruders,<br>
keen to discover<br> 
<br>
Back then, when public gardens were the backdrop for<br> 
every clumsy family shoot<br>
and disposable cameras were used to tell stories<br>
to the people of those sandy slums, desperate to see London, 1993<br>
<br>
Throbbing eyes, moving from one familiar<br>
face to the other,<br>
pausing at stills of oblivious faces,<br>
now departed.<br>
<br>
Overwhelmed with nostalgia, your grubby<br>
pages usher me to a cross-eyed infant, painfully<br>
unrecognisable, she, scrutinises me then<br>
babbles something tender in the language of her world—<br>
<br>
That world no longer exists.<br>
No longer possible are; photo shoots in public gardens, parents when<br> 
they weren’t parents, leaping out of swirling buses,<br>
birthday celebrations for that gawking toddler<br>
now woman, who ceases to exist in some outlandish world.<br>
